Each lecture has one or more "Your Choice" reading assignments.
During the semester, you **must** complete **at least two** "Your Choice" readings and do
an associated task. Most "Your Choice" readings are research papers from
the software engineering literature: the idea is that you will do a
deeper dive on two topics that interest you. If you're not sure how to
approach reading a research paper, there are [resources to help you](../tutorials/how-to-read-a-paper.md).

Some "Your Choice" readings have a specific task associated with them; if
you choose one of those, complete the task and then submit the result
on Canvas. If there is no task associated with an "Your Choice" reading,
the task is to write a one-page reaction to the paper that explains what you
have learned and submit that to Canvas. (Note that one page is the **maximum**:
it would be wise to use as much of it as you can. Do not use a font smaller than size
10.)
There is no required format for your reaction, but you might
consider including any or all of the following:
* a one or two paragraph summary of the key points of the paper
* a list of the paper’s strengths: what did the paper do well, scientifically?
* a list of the paper’s weaknesses: what did the paper do poorly? Did it makes claims you didn't believe?
* a description of how this paper might be useful to a software engineer working in industry (be sure to be specific)
* a description of how you might apply a lesson from the paper to your own work, now or in the future

When you submit an "Your Choice" reading task, be sure to include in your submission the title
of the reading.

One "Your Choice" reading is due ~50% of the way through class.
The other is due at the end of the
semester.
For the first "Your Choice" reading, you aren’t restricted to
readings that are associated with lectures earlier in the semester:
you are always welcome to read ahead.
