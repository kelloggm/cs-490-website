# Demos

Each group project team needs to do at least three demos during the semester: two
for the instructor and your group project mentor, and one for the whole class.

## Wizard-of-Oz Demo **Due Friday 3 November 2023, 5:00pm EST**{: .label .label-red }

The first demo is the ["Wizard-of-Oz"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard_of_Oz_experiment) demo.
In this demo, you'll show what your project will look like when it is finished. In this demo, you don't
need to actually have any of your code working yet: instead, you'll "fake" working code to show off
your vision for your finished project.

How you fake your finished project is up to you, and will probably vary quite a bit between projects.
Some options include:
* using PowerPoint or a similar slideshow tool to build slides that look like your finished feature.
You can use slide animations or transitions to show what your feature will look like in action.
* doing the same using a professional animation tool, such as Adobe Animate or a similar tool
* building a "paper prototype" of the feature, and manually transitioning between its states
* anything else you can imagine.

The key is that you need to convince the course staff that you've thought through how your feature will
behave in enough detail to implement it.

Aim for your demo to take about five minutes, and to showcase all of your feature's user stories
from your revised project proposal. The demo will usually occur during your regular weekly meeting with your
project mentor during the week that the demo is due, which the instructor will try to attend. In the event of a conflict, the instructor will let
you know the week beforehand, but it will be up to you to schedule an alternative slot that all of you,
your project mentor, and the instructor can attend before the deadline.

### Rubric (out of 25 points, 2.5% of final project grade)

#### Satisfactory:
* Demo materials are professional in appearance
* Demo is about five minutes long
* Demo showcases all user stories from revised project proposal
* Feature(s) demonstrated are plausible to implement

#### Meets minimum requirements:
* Demo is between 3 and 7 minutes long
* Demo showcases at least two user stories from the revised project proposal

## Preliminary Demo  **Due Friday 1 December 2023, 5:00pm EST**{: .label .label-red }

By the preliminary demo, you should have a significant part of the coding for your
feature completed. In this demo, you should show that at least one of the user
stories from your revised project proposal is substantially complete. Focus the
demo around that user story.

For this demo, your code must be deployed in a covey.town instance (but the instance is
permitted to be local to the demo laptop). All demonstrated feature(s) must be implemented:
you may not "fake" them as you could in the Wizard-of-Oz demo. All code used in the demo
must be committed to your project GitHub repository and should have been reviewed by at
least one team member other than its author.

Aim for your demo to take about five minutes. The demo will usually occur during your regular weekly meeting with your
project mentor during the week that the demo is due, which the instructor will try to attend. In the event of a conflict, the instructor will let
you know the week beforehand, but it will be up to you to schedule an alternative slot that all of you,
your project mentor, and the instructor can attend before the deadline.

### Rubric (out of 50 points, 5% of final project grade)

#### Satisfactory:
* Demo shows a user story from the revised project proposal
* Demo is fully functional (no crashes, unexplained hangs, etc.)
* Code is checked into your project GitHub repository and has been through a thorough code review (note: a portion of the grade for this demo
is based on the quality of your code reviews up to this point)
* Code is demonstrated in a running covey.town instance
* Demo takes about 5 minutes

#### Meets minimum requirements:
* Demo shows working code related to your project
* Code is checked into your project GitHub, and no code was pushed directly to `main` without a review
* Code is demonstrated in a running covey.town instance
* Demo takes between 3 and 7 minutes
