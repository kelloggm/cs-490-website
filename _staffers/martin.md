Office Hours: TBD eastern, GITC 4314; or by appointment.

To schedule an appointment with me, check [my
calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bWprNzZAbmppdC5lZHU)
and add a calendar event in any open spot that works for you during
regular business hours (Monday to Friday, 9-5:30). You must schedule
meetings at least 24 hours in advance, or I will automatically decline
them.

In your invitation, you must, at a minimum, 1) invite me to the event,
2) add a note to the event description that mentions CS 490 and what you'd like to meet about,
and 3) specify whether you would prefer the meeting to be in-person or remote.
It is unprofessional to schedule a meeting with me unless you have exhausted all other options
to solve the issue (for example, don't scheduled a meeting with me about a homework issue until
you have attended a TA's office hours and asked there).
