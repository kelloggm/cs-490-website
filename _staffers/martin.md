To schedule an appointment with me, check [my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bWprNzZAbmppdC5lZHU)
and add a calendar event in any open spot that works for you. In your invitation, you must, at a minimum, 1) invite me to the event
and 2) add a note to the event description that mentions CS 490 and what you'd like to meet about.
