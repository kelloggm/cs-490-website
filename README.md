# Welcome to CS 490!

Welcome to CS 490: Guided Design in Software Engineering! This is a
course about building software that satisfies stronger properties than
“it works”: it’s about building software that is correct, reliable,
maintainable, testable, and usable. That is, this course will teach
you about how to build software *well*.

The course is structured around giving you experience in both the
theory (through readings and lectures) and the practice (through
programming assignments and a large group project) of software
engineering.

On this course website, you can find:
- the [syllabus](about.md),
- [announcements](announcements.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page,
- and a weekly [schedule](schedule.md).
