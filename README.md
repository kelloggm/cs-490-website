# Welcome to CS 684!

Welcome to CS 684! This class is focused on software quality: both how
to assess it and how to achieve it in your own work. The course
therefore has two technical focuses: **testing** and **static analysis**, both
of which are important for assuring quality in the real world. We’ll
spend roughly 60% of the course (through spring break) on testing, and
the rest of the course on static analysis. My goal in this course is
to get you up-to-date with the best practices at the **very best**
software engineering firms in the world in these two topics: that is,
the goal of this course is to give you a firm foundation in the
“state-of-the-practice” in industry. Note that reaching this level
requires us to engage with the research literature, as the top
engineers at the best software firms do—--especially the most important
papers from the past 10-20 years.

On this course website, you can find:
- the [syllabus](about.md),
- a [course calendar](calendar.md) (which includes links to the required readings),
- links to all [assignments](./projects),
- useful [tutorials](tutorials.md),
- a [staff](staff.md) page, and
- information about how I write [exams](exam.md) (including old exams that I have written for undergraduate versions of this course, with solutions).
