: [Introduction](#)
  : No reading, but you should come to class (even if you're on the waitlist) to do an in-class activity. If you're unable to come to class (e.g., you're sick), email me - the activity can also be completed remotely, and it's important that everyone does it.

  : **Mandatory reading**: Spolsky's [The Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) (note that this article is from 2000, so the examples are a little dated) and Keshav's [How to Read a Paper](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf)
  
    **Optional reading**: read every abstract in the [latest FSE proceedings](https://dblp.org/db/conf/sigsoft/fse2022.html) and make a list of words you donâ€™t know. Then, look up at least 5 of those words and write a brief definition. Submit the list of words and the 5 definitions.
