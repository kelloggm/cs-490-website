    **Optional reading**: read 10 abstracts in the [latest FSE proceedings](https://dblp.org/db/conf/sigsoft/fse2022.html) and make a list of words you donâ€™t know. Then, look up at least 5 of those words and write a brief definition. Submit the list of words, the 5 definitions, and the titles of the papers whose abstracts you read. (I recommend choosing the ten 10 papers whose titles sound the most interesting to you.)
