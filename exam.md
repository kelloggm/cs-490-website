# Exams

My exams are generally cumulative: anything
we've covered in the course up to the point at
which you take the exam is fair game. I may also
include questions about assigned mandatory readings,
homework assignments, or any other class content
that you are supposed to have viewed. Notably,
this does not generally include the "Your Choice"
readings: I don't expect you to have read all of those,
so questions about them will always offer you a choice
of which reading to answer a question about.
See the ["Your Choice" readings page](../projects/optional-readings.html)
for more information about how the "Your Choice" readings will
be assessed on the exams.

My exam design philosophy is to aim for a wide range
of question difficulties: I try to include both some questions
that I think every student should get right and some questions
that I think are difficult enough that only those who have deeply
understood multiple concepts that we covered in class will even be
able to answer them in a reasonable way, and everything in between.

To help you prepare for this semester's exams, below you can find
links to two exams from last semester (a practice exam that I distributed
before the final, and the actual final exam), both of which have
solutions ("keys"). Both of these exams cover the whole course, so
you'll want to be careful when studying for the mid-term---not everything
on these exams will have been covered by then. Hopefully, these exams
will give you a good idea of the sort of questions that I like to
ask on exams.
