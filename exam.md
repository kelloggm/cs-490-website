# Exams

My exams are generally cumulative: anything
we've covered in the course up to the point at
which you take the exam is fair game. I may also
include questions about assigned mandatory readings,
homework assignments, or any other class content
that you are supposed to have viewed.

My exam design philosophy is to aim for a wide range
of question difficulties: I try to include both some questions
that I think every student should get right and some questions
that I think are difficult enough that only those who have deeply
understood multiple concepts that we covered in class will even be
able to answer them in a reasonable way, and everything in between.

To help you prepare for this class' exams, below you can find
links to exams from my undergraduate software engineering course, all of which have
solutions ("keys"). These exams are for a lower-level but broader course, so
you'll want to be careful when studying using them---not everything
on these exams will be covered in this class. I'm releasing them to you here so
that you can get an idea of the sorts of exam questions that I like to ask,
and so that you'll be prepared for the format of the exams (I expect
the exams in 684 to follow the same general format).
